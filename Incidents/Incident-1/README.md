## Incident Response Plan for Payment Gateway Service Outage

### 1. Incident Response Plan:

**Objective:** Restore connectivity to the payment gateway service to minimize revenue loss and ensure customer transactions can be processed.

**Steps:**

1. **Incident Detection and Alerting:** Upon observing a sudden spike in error rates and loss of connectivity to the payment gateway service, the incident should be promptly detected through monitoring tools such as New Relic, CloudWatch, and Splunk. Automated alerts should trigger notifications to the incident response team.
You can automate and create alarms to send notifications to a Platform like slack for updates.
A sample code is given in code/rds-cloudwatch-sns-slack.tf

2. **Incident Triage:** The incident response team should convene immediately to triage the situation. This involves gathering information about the symptoms, impact, and timeline of the incident to understand its severity and prioritize response efforts.

3. **Isolate Affected Services:** Determine whether the issue lies with the payment gateway service itself or if it's a broader issue affecting other components in the system. Isolate the affected services to prevent further impact on other parts of the system.

4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause(s) of the outage. Analyze logs from Splunk, performance metrics from New Relic, and resource utilization data from CloudWatch to pinpoint the underlying issue(s).
****In case of MYSQL DB****: 
You can set a profiler, to check which query/Transaction in MYSQL is taking long, if there is any latency issue in DB Queries.

```sql
SET PROFILING = 1; 
SET profiling_history_size = 0; 
SET profiling_history_size = 15; 
/* Your query should be here */
SHOW PROFILES; 
SELECT state, ROUND(SUM(duration),5) AS `duration (summed) in sec` FROM information_schema.profiling WHERE query_id = 3 GROUP BY state ORDER BY `duration (summed) in sec` DESC; 
SET PROFILING = 0; 
EXPLAIN /* Your query again should appear here */; 
```

****In case of pod in Kubernetes Cluster****:

Check the pods CPU and RAM. In case of RAM and CPU exceeded it results in crashLoopBackOff state, also check the QualityOfService assigned to a pod. If any of the requests and Limits are assigned to the pod, which results in throttling.

5. **Mitigation:** Implement immediate measures to mitigate the impact of the outage. This could involve restarting containers in the Kubernetes clusters hosting the payment gateway service, scaling up resources in AWS amplify, or failing over to a backup database instance in Amazon RDS.

6. **Communication:** Keep stakeholders informed about the incident, its impact, and the ongoing response efforts. Provide regular updates on the progress of resolution and estimated time to recovery (ETR).

7. **Resolution:** Once the root cause(s) have been identified and mitigation measures implemented, verify that connectivity to the payment gateway service has been restored. Conduct thorough testing to ensure that customer transactions can be processed without any issues.

8. **Post-Incident Review:** After the incident has been resolved, conduct a post-incident review (PIR) to assess the effectiveness of the response process and identify areas for improvement. Document lessons learned and update incident response procedures accordingly.

### 2. Parameters to be Observed:

- Error rates: Monitor for sudden spikes in error rates exceeding predefined thresholds.
- Connectivity status: Monitor the connectivity status of the payment gateway service.
- Resource utilization: Monitor resource utilization metrics such as CPU, memory, and network usage.
- Database performance: Monitor database performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and connection errors.

### 3. Probable Root Causes:

- Network issues: Connectivity loss due to network interruptions or misconfigurations.
- Infrastructure failures: Failure of Kubernetes clusters, AWS amplify deployment, or Amazon RDS instances.
- Application bugs: Software bugs or configuration errors in the payment gateway service.
- Database issues: Performance issues or database connection errors in Amazon RDS.

### 4. Proposed Solutions:

#### 1. Network Troubleshooting:
- **Objective:** Investigate and resolve any network-related issues causing connectivity loss to the payment gateway service.
- **Actions:**
  - **Network Configurations:** Review and validate network configurations for the Kubernetes clusters, AWS amplify deployment, and other relevant network components.
  - **Network Outages:** Check for any ongoing network outages or disruptions that may be impacting connectivity to the payment gateway service.
  - **Routing:** Ensure proper routing is configured to direct traffic to the payment gateway service and that there are no routing issues causing connectivity issues.

#### 2. Infrastructure Resilience:
- **Objective:** Enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure components to prevent future outages.
- **Actions:**
  - **Redundancy:** Implement redundancy for critical components such as Kubernetes clusters and database instances to minimize the impact of single points of failure.
  - **Failover Mechanisms:** Set up failover mechanisms to automatically switch to backup resources or instances in the event of failures or outages.
  - **High Availability:** Configure Kubernetes clusters and other infrastructure components for high availability to ensure continuous operation even during failures or maintenance.

#### 3. Application Patches:
- **Objective:** Address any known software bugs or configuration issues in the payment gateway service to improve reliability and performance.
- **Actions:**
  - **Patch Deployment:** Deploy patches or updates to the payment gateway service to fix identified bugs or vulnerabilities.
  - **Configuration Checks:** Review and validate application configurations to ensure they align with best practices and are optimized for performance and reliability.
  - **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of the patched application to verify that the fixes have been successfully applied and do not introduce any new issues.

#### 4. Database Optimization:
- **Objective:** Optimize database performance to improve the overall reliability and responsiveness of the payment gateway service.
- **Actions:**
  - **Query Optimization:** Analyze and optimize database queries to reduce latency and improve throughput.
  - **Instance Scaling:** Consider scaling up database instances in Amazon RDS to handle increased transaction volumes and improve overall performance.
  - **Caching Mechanisms:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
  - **Monitoring and Tuning:** Continuously monitor database performance metrics and tune database settings as needed to maintain optimal performance.

By implementing these proposed solutions, the incident response team can address the root causes of the payment gateway service outage and improve the overall reliability and availability of the system.
