# Recovery Process for Deleted Access Key File

## Recovery Process:

1. **Assess the Situation:** Quickly assess the impact of the deleted file on system availability and security. Determine the criticality of the deleted file and its implications on services and data security.

2. **Isolate the System:** If feasible, isolate the affected system to prevent any further modifications or damage to other files or data.

3. **Identify the Backup:** Check if there is a recent backup of the access key file available. If so, proceed with restoring the file from the backup.

4. **File Recovery Tools:** Utilize file recovery tools such as `extundelete` (for ext file systems) or `PhotoRec` to attempt the recovery of the deleted file from the server's disk.

5. **Data Recovery Services:** If internal efforts fail to recover the file, consider engaging professional data recovery services for assistance.

6. **Restoration and Validation:** Once the file is recovered, validate its integrity and correctness to ensure it hasn't been tampered with during the recovery process.

7. **Update Access Credentials:** If necessary, update the access credentials associated with the recovered file to mitigate any potential security risks.

8. **System Integrity Check:** Perform a thorough system integrity check to ensure there are no lingering issues or vulnerabilities resulting from the incident.

## Future Prevention Plan:

1. **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup strategy to ensure critical files and data are regularly backed up to prevent data loss in the event of accidental deletion or system failure.

2. **Access Control:** Enforce strict access control policies to limit access to sensitive files and credentials only to authorized personnel.

3. **Version Control:** Utilize version control systems such as Git to track changes made to critical files, providing a mechanism to revert changes if necessary and share the git repository access only with Devops/Admin Team. If possible , install a Secure mechanism like Hashicorp Vault to store data as secrets.

4. **Training and Awareness:** Conduct regular training sessions to educate users on best practices for handling sensitive data and the importance of data protection measures.

5. **File Auditing:** Implement file auditing mechanisms to monitor file access and modifications, enabling quick detection of unauthorized activities or suspicious behavior.

6. **Automated Monitoring:** Deploy automated monitoring systems to alert administrators of any unusual file deletion or modification activities in real-time.

7. **Immutable File Systems:** Consider implementing immutable file systems or file-level WORM (Write Once Read Many) protection to prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical files.

8. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop a comprehensive incident response plan outlining the steps to be taken in the event of data loss or security breaches, ensuring a swift and coordinated response to minimize impact.

By following these recovery and prevention measures, the organization can promptly recover from the incident while minimizing the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future.
